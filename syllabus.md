## Class Meetings

This course is delivered entirely online in an asynchronous format. Recorded lessons and written instructions will be provided in the Brightspace site.

## Course Description

The integration of the PHP programming language with MySQL database technology enables PHP developers to build database-enabled Web applications. During the course, students will walk through the development of a complete social media site, learning to write secure scripts that allow visitors to add information and dynamically display filtered data from a MySQL database. At the end of the class, student will have reusable code templates to create dynamic, database driven Web applications. *Prerequisite:* CIS 333. (3 credits)

### Final Project

Each student will create a simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) Web application as their final project, with a user authentication system and data stored in a database. This will utilize the core PHP concepts covered in the course, including object-oriented PHP, database management, database manipulation with PHP, state management, and error handling. A full description of the project along with a grading rubric will be available during the first week of the course, including a sample application topic. Each student will have the choice of either building the application described in the sample or creating their own application that meets the same requirements. Each student will submit their choice of final project topic during the fourth week of the course.

### Religious Holidays

Students may request accommodation for their observance of a religious holiday. Instructors may grant time accommodations such as excusing an absence, rescheduling a project deadline, or adjusting the exam schedule as long as it is deemed reasonable by the instructor. Students who anticipate a conflict must notify their instructor within two weeks of the official start of the academic session to make arrangements. In the case of an internship or clinicals, students should consult course faculty per the program policies as soon as possible.

## Grading Criteria

- **10%** of your grade will be determined by Applied Learning Activities. ***Note:** In order to receive credit for Applied Learning Activities, there must be evidence in your repository that you followed along with the weekly tutorial videos.*
- **25%** of your grade will be determined by Reinforcement Exercises.
- **20%** of your grade will be determined by Discovery Projects.
- **15%** of your grade will be determined by Comprehension Check Quizzes.
- **10%** of your grade will be determined by Final Exam.
- **20%** of your grade will be determined by the Final Project.

A 94-100%, A- 90-93%, B+ 87-89%, B 83-86%, B- 80-82%, C+ 77-79%, C 73-76%, C- 70-72%, D+ 67-69%, D 63-66%, D- 60-62%, F below 60%.

## Communication

Students are encouraged to ask questions or make comments and/or suggestions. This helps you reinforce your learning and maximize your learning experience. The Brightspace content management system is available for student chat discussions, email communication, and to view course announcements at <https://courses.maine.edu/d2l/home>

For purposes of this class, communication is defined as interactively engaging with the Brightspace system, contacting the instructor via email or phone if you have questions outside of class, and responding to the instructor's emails or phone calls.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity means that a student's work is the product of their own effort. Violations of academic integrity include such behaviors as cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, and are described more fully in the UMA Student Academic Integrity Code, which is published in the online UMA Student Handbook. Each student is responsible for learning the standards of academic integrity and ensuring that their work meets these standards. Failure to do so may result in appropriate sanctions consistent with the UMA Student Academic Integrity Policy. If you have questions about the academic integrity of your work, discuss these with your instructor before submitting the work. The full policy can be found at <https://www.uma.edu/compliance/handbook/academic-integrity/>.

### Generative Artificial Intelligence

Students are welcome to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools (including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and others) for brainstorming, ideation, and producing Web page content. If you use any generative AI tool as part of an assignment, you must include a statement describing how you used it. For example, if you use it for writing the content for your final project's home page, include in your submission comments:

1. Which tool you used
2. The prompt that you used (what you typed into the tool)
3. A brief explanation of how much of the tool's output you used and how much you changed

## Class Withdrawals

Before withdrawing from a class, students are encouraged to contact the instructor. The instructor may be able to offer an alternative to dropping the class. Ultimately, if a student finds it necessary to withdraw from a class, students must follow school policy. Students who just stop attending a class, but who have not officially withdrawn, will receive a grade based on work completed up until the last date of attendance. Most often, this results in a failing grade. _Students are not automatically withdrawn from a class._

- _L Grade:_ The grade of “L” is awarded if you stop attending, but do not withdraw from the course. The “L” grade is computed into the grade point average as a failing grade and may affect a student’s financial aid eligibility.
- _W Grade:_ The grade of “W”, withdraw, is posted if you drop the course during the first 60% of the semester. A “W” grade is not computed into the grade point average. After the 60% point, the grade of WF may be assigned and may affect a student’s financial aid eligibility.
- _WF Grade:_ The grade awarded when a course is dropped after 60% of the term is completed depends upon your performance up to that point. If you are passing the course the grade of “W” is awarded. If you are failing the course at the time of withdrawal the grade of “WF”, withdraw failing, may be assigned. A “WF” is computed into the grade point average as a failing grade and may affect a student’s financial aid eligibility.

## Incompletes

An “Incomplete” is a temporary grade indicating that specific arrangements have been made with the instructor to complete work by a later date, not to exceed 150 days after the end of the term. If a student has completed almost all of the work for a course, an Incomplete grade may be appropriate. An Incomplete may be extended once by the instructor for a period not to exceed 150 days.

Any additional extension of an incomplete grade by the instructor requires the Dean’s approval.
Awarding of the incomplete grade is at the discretion of the instructor. If the incomplete grade is determined to be appropriate, the instructor will complete the Incomplete Grade Contract in MaineStreet, which specifies the following:

- The work to be completed by the student.
- The date by which the student will complete the work, not to exceed 150 days after the end of the term.
- The grade the student will receive if the work is not completed. If no grade is specified, the Incomplete is converted to an “F” after 150 days or as specified by the contract.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability which may affect your ability to participate fully in this course, it is your responsibility to request accommodations promptly. Contact Academic Success to discuss possible assistance. Accommodations must be requested each semester, and are not provided retroactively.
