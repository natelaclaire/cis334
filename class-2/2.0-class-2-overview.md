# 2.0 Class 2 Overview

Welcome, everyone.  Today we begin our exploration of object‑oriented programming, abbreviated OOP, in PHP 8.3, with some notes about changes in PHP 8.4.  In the first semester you learned foundational PHP skills—functions, control structures, arrays, files, user input.  This term we build on that foundation by designing applications with classes, objects and more structured design techniques.  By the end of this module you’ll know how to create and use classes, manage visibility, apply inheritance, and work with interfaces and traits.

Before we begin, a word of warning: the book covers OOP after databases and state management, so chapter 10's examples include concepts from those topics. In this week's videos, we'll be using examples that don't incorporate those topics for now. As you'll see, this will allow us to make use of OOP concepts when we dig into those topics, so that we can take full advantage of modern code structures and language improvements.

Let’s dive in!
