### Slide 14 – Best Practices & Tips

“To conclude, here are some best practices.  **Choose appropriate visibility** for your members: don’t make everything public.  **Prefer composition over inheritance** where possible; combine objects rather than build long inheritance chains.  Always **declare types and enable strict typing** for reliability, especially when interacting with MySQL later.  **Define interfaces** to decouple your code from specific implementations.  **Use traits carefully**; avoid name conflicts and don’t overuse them.  **Explicitly call parent constructors and destructors** when extending classes.  Finally, adopt the **PSR‑12 coding standards** and autoloading conventions to keep your codebase organized and professional.  Following these guidelines will help you meet the course outcomes: writing clean, maintainable, secure PHP scripts and preparing you for interacting with databases.”

“Let’s recap.  OOP organizes code around objects, improving maintainability and clarity.  Classes define state and behaviour; objects are specific instances.  Encapsulation with proper visibility protects internal state.  Inheritance, interfaces, traits and polymorphism enable code reuse and extensibility.  PHP 8.3 offers typed constants, dynamic constant fetch, override checks and deep cloning of readonly properties.  Keep exploring design patterns and best practices to master object‑oriented PHP.  In the next units we’ll connect these principles to MySQL, designing relational schemas, writing SQL queries and building dynamic, stateful web applications.  Thank you!”
