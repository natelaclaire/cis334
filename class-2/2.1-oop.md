# 2.1 An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in PHP (pages 557-564)

## Why OOP?

Why bother with OOP?  To summarize what is explained in more detail in the book, there are several benefits to OOP.  First, classes allow us to **model real‑world entities** by encapsulating both data and behaviour.  Second, OOP promotes **reuse and maintainability**—instead of copying code, you can inherit behaviours or compose objects together.  Third, encapsulation enables us to **hide internal state** and expose a clean API, reducing coupling and making future changes safer.  Finally, OOP supports **extensibility**; polymorphism and interfaces let you add new features without breaking existing code.  These benefits are especially important in larger projects such as database‑driven web applications.

## Classes & Objects

As explained in the book, a **class** is similar to a blueprint describing the elements of an object, while an **object** is like a house - a specifc **instance** of the class, with its own internal state that is specific to that object and not shared with other objects of the same class.

We saw [a simple example of how to create an object from a class](https://github.com/uma-cis333/discovery-projects-nlumademo/blob/572a1e11f0caa496289223da8cce4780f7ae6f17/includes/functions.php#L82C13-L82C42), referred to as **instantiating** an object, in the CIS 333 Discovery Projects:

```php
$parsedown = new Parsedown();
```

In this example, we are creating an object and storing it in a variable, `$parsedown`. To instantiate an object, we use the `new` keyword followed by the name of the class (`Parsedown` in this case) and then open and close parentheses, similar to how you call a function. Inside those parentheses there can optionally be parameters that you are passing to the class **constructor**, which is a special class method that is automatically called when a new object is instantiated to prepare the object, such as initializing object properties.

## Working with Object Properties & Methods

Classes define **properties** to hold state and **methods** to define behavior. A class property is essentially a variable that is declared as part of the class and a method is essentially a function that is declared as part of the class. In fact, we use the `function` keyword to define methods, but we'll get to that here in a bit.

In the CIS 333 Discovery Projects, we saw [an example of how to use properties and methods on objects](https://github.com/uma-cis333/discovery-projects-nlumademo/blob/572a1e11f0caa496289223da8cce4780f7ae6f17/includes/functions.php#L450):

```php
// instantiating an object of the PHPMailer class, passing true to the constructor
// this class name is namespaced, which we'll talk more about next week
$mail = new PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer(true);

// calling a method on the object
$mail->isSMTP();

// assigning values to object properties
$mail->Host = 'localhost';
$mail->SMTPAuth = false;
$mail->Port = 25;

// using the value of an object property
return $mail->ErrorInfo;
```

Note that we use the member selection notation (`->`) between the object variable name and the method or property name. Also note that we do not place a dollar sign before the property name.
