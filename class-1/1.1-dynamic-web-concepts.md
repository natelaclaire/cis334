# 1.1 *Dynamic Web Concepts*

**\[Opening Slide: Title – “Dynamic Web Concepts”]**

**Narrator/Instructor Voiceover:**
Welcome to *Dynamic Web Concepts*! In this lesson, we’ll explore one of the most important distinctions in web development: the difference between static and dynamic websites. Understanding this difference is the foundation for everything we’ll build in this course on PHP and MySQL.

**\[Slide: Static Websites – Simple and Fixed]**

Static websites are made up of fixed HTML, CSS, and sometimes a little JavaScript.

* Every visitor sees the same content.
* Pages must be updated manually by editing the code.
* They’re fast, secure, and good for small projects like portfolios or brochures.

**Example:**
Imagine a restaurant site with a plain HTML page listing the menu. If the menu changes, the developer has to edit the HTML file directly.

**\[Slide: Dynamic Websites – Interactive and Database-Driven]**

Dynamic websites, on the other hand, are generated *on the fly*.

* Content is pulled from a database or other data source.
* Visitors may see different information depending on their input, login status, or search filters.
* Updating content doesn’t always require editing code—it can be managed through the database.

**Examples:**

* Think about a social media platform. Each user sees their own posts, friends, and messages. The site looks the same structurally, but the content is unique and constantly changing.
* Remember the Discovery Projects site that we built in CIS 333? The random selection of portfolio entries is a tiny example of dynamic Web content, but it lacks any personalization. Imagine a site that learns from the visitor's behavior, highlighting content that might be of interest to the user on the next visit. For example, if a visitor fills out a form to register for an event for non-profits, on their next visit the home page might include a case study for a non-profit, selected based on that past behavior. On the other hand, if the visitor had requested information about a solution for Fortune 500 companies, the same space might feature a case study about an enterprise client on the next visit.
* Amazon is another classic example of a dynamic site, loading live recommendations, prices, stock levels, etc.

**\[Slide: Why This Matters for CIS 334]**

In this course, you’ll learn to:

* Use **PHP** to connect your website to a **MySQL database**.
* Write scripts that handle user input, filter data, and display it dynamically.
* Protect your site against common threats like SQL injection.
* Build reusable templates to make web development more efficient.

By the end of the semester, you’ll move from static HTML pages to dynamic, data-driven applications—just like the websites you use every day.

**\[Slide: Key Takeaway]**

Static sites = simple, fixed, one-size-fits-all.
Dynamic sites = flexible, data-driven, personalized.

This course will give you the tools to build modern, interactive, dynamic websites using PHP and MySQL.

**Narrator/Instructor Voiceover:**
Now that you understand the difference between static and dynamic web concepts, we’re ready to dive into how PHP makes dynamic websites possible. Up next, we’ll begin working with PHP Data Objects to safely interact with databases.
