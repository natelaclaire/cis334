# 14.1 Introduction to PHP Error Types

## **Opening**

Today we’re starting a short series on error handling and debugging in PHP. Before we look at tools or techniques, we need to understand the different types of errors PHP can generate. Once you know how to read these messages, figuring out what went wrong gets much easier.

PHP 8.3 continues to refine its error reporting system, but the core categories remain familiar: syntax errors, parse errors, runtime errors, and warnings or notices. Each one tells a different story about what PHP was trying to do when things went wrong.

---

## **1. Syntax Errors**

PHP stops immediately when it encounters invalid code structure. A missing semicolon, a stray bracket, or using a keyword incorrectly can all trigger a syntax error.

**Example message:**

```
Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ')' in index.php on line 12
```

What this means:
PHP tried to read your file, but the code wasn’t valid PHP. These errors always point to the line where PHP *noticed* the issue, which might be just after the real mistake.

**Common causes:**

* Missing semicolons
* Unmatched parentheses, braces, or brackets
* Misspelled keywords
* Using an expression where PHP expects a statement

---

## **2. Parse Errors**

A parse error is closely related to a syntax error, and in modern PHP the messages often overlap. A parse error appears when PHP’s parser can’t make sense of the structure of your code.

**Examples:**

* Missing closing quotes
* Declaring functions or classes incorrectly
* Invalid use of operators

Even though the message may look similar to a syntax error, parse errors usually happen when PHP can’t build the script’s syntax tree at all. The fix is almost always structural.

---

## **3. Fatal Errors**

A fatal error happens when PHP understands your code but can’t execute it because something essential is missing.

**Typical examples:**

* Calling a function that doesn’t exist
* Instantiating a class that hasn’t been loaded
* Running out of memory
* Using incompatible types in certain function calls

In PHP 8+, many previously fatal errors now throw exceptions, but true fatal errors still stop execution immediately.

---

## **4. Errors That Throw Exceptions**

PHP 7+ introduced `Error` and its subclasses, which act like exceptions. PHP 8.3 continues this model.

These errors include:

* `TypeError` — wrong data type passed into a function
* `ArgumentCountError` — calling a function with too few or too many parameters
* `ValueError` — invalid value where the type was correct

These are often caused by stricter type checks that are part of modern PHP.

Because they behave like exceptions, you can catch them with try/catch blocks:

```php
try {
    foo(123);
} catch (TypeError $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

---

## **5. Warnings**

Warnings tell you something failed, but PHP doesn’t stop running.

**Examples:**

* Trying to open a file that doesn’t exist
* Using deprecated functions
* Passing incorrect arguments that aren’t strict enough to trigger a TypeError

Warnings are important because they often reveal assumptions that will break your app later.

---

## **6. Notices**

Notices are the lowest-level error messages. PHP is still able to run the script, but something is off.

**Common notices:**

* Using an undefined variable
* Accessing an array key that doesn’t exist
* Using properties that haven’t been declared

Notices highlight sloppy code or typos that can turn into bugs down the line.

---

## **7. Deprecation Notices**

PHP uses deprecation notices to warn you that a feature will be removed in a future release.

In PHP 8.3 you may see messages like:

```
Deprecated: strftime() is deprecated
```

These are not failures—they’re reminders to update your code before it breaks in a later version.

---

## **8. Why This Matters**

One of our course outcomes is the ability to interpret and debug common PHP error messages.
Understanding these categories will help you quickly diagnose issues in your form handlers, database scripts, and object-oriented PHP code as we move deeper into the course.

In upcoming videos, we’ll look at:

* How PHP displays errors
* How to control error reporting in development vs. production
* Debugging tools and techniques
* Best practices for writing code that prevents errors in the first place

---

## **Closing**

The key takeaway today: error messages are not the enemy. They’re clues that point you to the fix. The more familiar you become with the types of PHP errors, the faster you’ll debug your code.

In the next video, we’ll talk about configuring PHP’s error reporting settings, including how PHP 8.3 handles error levels and how to set up a safe development environment.
