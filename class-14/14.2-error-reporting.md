# 14.2 Error Reporting Settings and `display_errors`

## **Opening**

In our last video, we looked at the major types of PHP errors—syntax errors, fatal errors, warnings, notices, and exceptions. Now we’re going to see how PHP decides which errors to show and how they’re displayed. This is essential for debugging during development and equally important for keeping errors hidden in production.

---

## **1. Why Error Reporting Settings Matter**

PHP can generate detailed messages that help diagnose problems. But depending on your server settings, you might see everything, almost nothing, or something in between.

There are two main goals:

1. **During development:** see every error possible so you can fix issues early.
2. **In production:** hide errors from the public to avoid exposing sensitive details.

PHP gives us several directives to control this behavior.

---

## **2. `display_errors`**

This setting controls whether PHP shows errors directly in the browser.

* `display_errors = On`
  You see errors on the page. Great for development.

* `display_errors = Off`
  Errors are hidden from users. Required for production.

**Important:** In many hosting environments, this setting *cannot* be overridden inside code. You typically change it in **php.ini**, `.htaccess`, or the server control panel.

### Runtime example (works only if the server allows it):

```php
ini_set('display_errors', '1');
```

### Showing a safe message:

Even when errors are hidden, you can still send a generic message:

```php
echo "Something went wrong. Please try again.";
```

---

## **3. `error_reporting`**

This setting controls *which* types of errors PHP reports.

PHP 8.3 uses a modern set of constants, and the standard “show everything” setting is:

```php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
```

This tells PHP to report every error level, including deprecations and strict checks.

### During development:

```php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', '1');
```

### In production:

```php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', '0');
```

You still report everything, but you don’t show it to the user.

---

## **4. `log_errors`**

Instead of displaying errors, you can send them to a log file:

```ini
log_errors = On
error_log = /path/to/php-error.log
```

This is the correct approach for production servers. Errors stay private, but developers can still review them.

---

## **5. PHP 8.3 Changes Worth Noting**

PHP 8 continues to standardize error behavior around structured exception-like error types. That means:

* More errors are categorized as `Error` subclasses.
* Type mismatches and argument count issues generate clearer exceptions.
* Deprecation notices help you stay ahead of future breaking changes.

Because of this, turning off warnings or notices during development is no longer a good idea. PHP uses them to guide better coding practices.

---

## **6. Development-Friendly Error Setup**

This is a small snippet you can include at the top of scripts or in a `bootstrap.php` file:

```php
declare(strict_types=1);

error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', '1');
ini_set('log_errors', '1');
```

This ensures you see every issue and also record it.

---

## **7. Safe Production Setup**

You might place these in `php.ini` or a configuration file:

```ini
display_errors = Off
log_errors = On
error_reporting = E_ALL
```

This setup prevents PHP from revealing SQL queries, file paths, or stack traces to users.

---

## **8. Verifying Your Settings**

You can check your environment with:

```php
phpinfo();
```

This outputs everything PHP knows about its configuration. During development, it’s fine. On production servers, be careful—this page reveals a lot of information.

## **9. What We’ll Cover Next**

Now that you know how PHP reports errors and where they appear, our next video will explore practical debugging techniques:

* Using stack traces
* Common error patterns
* Debugging database code
* Browser dev tools
* Logging strategies
* IDE debugging with breakpoints

By the end of the series, you’ll know not only how to read PHP errors but how to systematically track down and fix them.
