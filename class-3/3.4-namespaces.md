# 3.4 Namespaces in PHP

Hi everyone! In this lesson, we’re going to talk about **namespaces in PHP**.

Namespaces help us organize our code and avoid naming conflicts, especially in larger projects or when we use third-party libraries.

---

## Why Namespaces?

Imagine you’re working on a project, and you have a class called `User`.

```php
class User {
    // ...
}
```

Now suppose you install a package that also has a `User` class. Suddenly, PHP doesn’t know which one you mean.

That’s where namespaces come in! A namespace works like a *folder* for your classes, functions, and constants.

---

## Defining a Namespace

Let’s put our `User` class into a namespace:

```php
namespace App\Models;

class User {
    public function __construct(public string $name) {}
}
```

Now this class is known as `App\Models\User`.

---

## Using a Namespaced Class

If we want to create a new user object, we need to either write the full path:

```php
$user = new \App\Models\User("Alice");
```

Or, we can **import** it with the `use` keyword:

```php
use App\Models\User;

$user = new User("Alice");
```

This is just like importing a module in other languages.

---

## Multiple Classes with the Same Name

Now here’s where namespaces really shine. Let’s say we also have a `User` class inside an `Admin` namespace:

```php
namespace App\Admin;

class User {
    public function __construct(public string $username) {}
}
```

In one script, we can use both classes:

```php
use App\Models\User as ModelUser;
use App\Admin\User as AdminUser;

$u1 = new ModelUser("Alice");
$u2 = new AdminUser("admin01");
```

By using aliases, we avoid conflicts and keep our code readable.

---

## Organizing Code

In real projects, namespaces usually match the folder structure. For example:

```
/App
    /Models/User.php
    /Admin/User.php
```

Inside `User.php`, you’d start with:

```php
namespace App\Models;
```

This keeps your codebase well-organized, especially as it grows.

---

## Functions and Constants

Namespaces don’t just apply to classes—you can also namespace functions and constants.

```php
namespace MathTools;

function add($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}

const PI = 3.14;
```

Then elsewhere:

```php
use function MathTools\add;
use const MathTools\PI;

echo add(2, 3); // 5
echo PI;        // 3.14
```

---

## Closing Thoughts

To sum up:

* Namespaces prevent naming conflicts and organize your code.
* Use the `namespace` keyword at the top of your file.
* Use the `use` keyword to import classes, functions, or constants.
* Aliases let you work with multiple classes that have the same name.

Namespaces are essential once your projects grow beyond just a few files.

Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you in the next lesson!
