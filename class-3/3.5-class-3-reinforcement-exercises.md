# 3.6 Class 3 Reinforcement Exercises

Before you begin the Reinforcement Exercises, remember to accept and merge the Pull Request that I've submitted for your weekly assignments repository, just as we did last week.

## Exercise 3-1

## Exercise 3-2

## Exercise 3-3

## Exercise 3-4

In this exercise, you'll practice creating and using namespaces to avoid naming conflicts.

1. Using your Codespace, find the folder `public/exercises/3-4-namespaces`.
2. Inside the folder, create two subfolders:

```
public/exercises/3-4-namespaces
    /Library
    /Store
```

3. In the **Library** folder, create a file named `Book.php` with the following code:

```php
<?php
namespace Library;

class Book {
    public function __construct(public string $title) {}

    public function getInfo(): string {
        return "Library Book: " . $this->title;
    }
}
```

4. In the **Store** folder, create a file named `Book.php` with this code:

```php
<?php
namespace Store;

class Book {
    public function __construct(public string $title, public float $price) {}

    public function getInfo(): string {
        return "Store Book: " . $this->title . " ($" . $this->price . ")";
    }
}
```

5. Now open the `public/exercises/3-4-namespaces/index.php` file. Notice that it:

   * Requires both class files.
   * Imports both classes with `use`.
   * Uses **aliases** to distinguish them.
   * Creates one library book and one store book.
   * Displays their information.

6. Open the page in a Web browser and confirm that the following appears:

```
Library Book: Pride and Prejudice
Store Book: Pride and Prejudice ($12.99)
```

7. Add a **Magazine** class to both the `Library` and `Store` namespaces. Then update `index.php` to demonstrate working with both `Magazine` classes using aliases (add a magazine from each namespace to the output).

8. Refresh the page to ensure that the magazines and books appear as expected.

## Exercise 3-5

In this exercise, you'll get some practice using an autoloader.

1. Using your Codespace, find the folder `public/exercises/3-5-autoloading`.
2. Inside the folder is a `classes` folder and an `index.php` file. Inside the `classes` folder are three files. The `Payable.php` file contains a modified version of our `Payable` interface from reinforcement exercise 2-3. The `Invoice.php` file contains a class that implements the `Payable` interface and the `Vendor.php` file contains a class that is needed for the `Invoice` class. Note that none of these files `require` or `include` any of the others. Also note that none of these files contain a `namespace` statement, which means that the classes are in the global namespace.
3. Open the `index.php` file. At the top is a simple autoloader that will look in the `classes` folder for a file with the same name (plus `.php`) as the class that needs to be loaded and, if the file exists, will require the file. The autoloader includes code that ensures that only non-namespaced classes are loaded by it, and also ensures that the class name is valid. Among other things, this ensures that the autoloader can't be utilized by a hacker to perform directory traversal.
4. Scroll down and you'll see that we've created two invoices, each with a different vendor. The `Vendor` objects are referred to as **anonymous objects** or **inline objects** because they are created inline at the time of use, without storing a reference in a variable.
5. Below that, we've created an array and stored each of the `Invoice` objects in that array.
6. Below that, we have a table that lists all payable objects in the array, calling the `getPayeeName()` and `getPayAmount()` methods required by the `Payable` interface.
7. Load the page in a browser and confirm that you see the two invoices listed.
8. Now, open the `2-3-employees.php` file from last week and copy the `Employee`, `SalariedEmployee`, and `HourlyEmployee` classes into three separate files with matching filenames in the `public/exercises/3-5-autoloading/classes` folder.
9. Add a `getPayeeName()` method to the `Employee` class that returns the employee's name (this can either duplicate the functionality of the `getName()` method or can call the `getName()` method).
10. Return to `index.php` and uncomment lines 42 and 43, which create new `HourlyEmployee` and `SalariedEmployee` objects.
11. Refresh the page in your browser and confirm that the employees show up in the table.
