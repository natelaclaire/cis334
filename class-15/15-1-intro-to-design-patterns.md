# 15.1 Introduction to Reusable Design Patterns

Welcome back, everyone. We’ve reached the final week of our course. Throughout the semester, we’ve built dynamic, database-driven features, learned how to structure an application, manage state, secure our forms, and work with object-oriented PHP. Now we’re going to look at the piece that ties all of this together: **Reusable Design Patterns**.

## **What This Week Is About**

In software development, patterns give us a standard way to solve problems we encounter again and again. They aren’t copy-and-paste templates. Instead, they give us **proven structures** we can adapt to the challenges in our own applications.

You’ve already used some patterns without naming them—like layering logic in functions, organizing code into classes, or separating database access from presentation.
This week, we’ll look at patterns intentionally. You’ll learn how to apply them in PHP so you can write cleaner, more consistent code, and so your future projects become easier to build and maintain.

## **Why Patterns Matter in PHP Development**

As your applications grow, the complexity grows with them. Patterns help you:

* Avoid rewriting the same logic again and again
* Keep your code predictable and easier to follow
* Reduce bugs caused by inconsistent structure
* Improve collaboration with other developers
* Build a foundation of reusable components you can use across projects

Patterns become especially valuable in modern PHP, where object-oriented design isn’t just a feature—it’s expected.

## **Patterns We’ll Explore**

We’ll look at some of the most useful patterns for server-side PHP:

* **Singleton** for shared resources like database connections
* **Factory** for building objects in a consistent way
* **Strategy** to swap behaviors without rewriting code
* **Observer** to trigger actions when something changes
* **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** as a larger organizational pattern
* And a few others to help you structure your final project and future apps

The goal isn’t memorizing every pattern. The goal is recognizing problems you can solve with patterns you know.

## **Patterns in the Context of Your Final Project**

Your final project will benefit directly from the patterns we cover. Even adding one or two can make your code easier to expand later. Think about:

* How reusable your database layer is
* Whether your form handlers share behavior
* How you load and manage user-defined objects
* How cleanly your application responds to changes in state

Patterns give you a shared vocabulary for those decisions.

## **Closing**

By the end of this week, you’ll have a toolkit of reusable design ideas you can apply anywhere you work with PHP and MySQL. This is what professional developers rely on every day. Let’s get started and see how these patterns can make your code stronger, simpler, and more scalable.
