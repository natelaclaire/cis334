# 15.7 Additional Patterns Overview

To wrap up this module, let’s look briefly at a few other patterns you may encounter as you continue working with PHP.

These aren’t required for this course, but they’re worth knowing.

---

### **Decorator**

Adds features to an object without modifying its original class.

```php
class Message {
    public function get() { return "Hello"; }
}

class ExclaimDecorator {
    public function __construct(private Message $msg) {}
    public function get() { return $this->msg->get() . "!"; }
}

echo (new ExclaimDecorator(new Message()))->get();
```

---

### **Adapter**

Makes incompatible interfaces work together.

```php
class Legacy {
    public function oldMethod() { return "Old"; }
}

class NewAdapter {
    public function __construct(private Legacy $obj) {}
    public function run() { return $this->obj->oldMethod(); }
}
```

---

### **Repository**

Abstracts database access so your models don’t depend on SQL.

```php
class UserRepository {
    public function findAll(PDO $db) {
        return $db->query("SELECT * FROM users")->fetchAll();
    }
}
```

Patterns give you a common toolbox. The more you use them, the more natural they become. They help you write predictable code, reduce bugs, and create reusable structures you can carry into any future project.
