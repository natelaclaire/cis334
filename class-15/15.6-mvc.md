# 15.6 MVC Pattern

Now let’s talk about [**Model-View-Controller (MVC)**](https://www.sitepoint.com/the-mvc-pattern-and-php-1/). MVC is a structural pattern, not just a class pattern. It organizes your entire application into three roles:

* **Model:** Data and business logic
* **View:** Output formatting
* **Controller:** Input, routing, and coordination

*Model:*

```php
class PostModel {
    public function getAll() {
        return ["Hello World", "Second Post"];
    }
}
```

*Controller:*

```php
class PostController {
    public function __construct(private PostModel $model) {}

    public function index() {
        $posts = $this->model->getAll();
        include "post_view.php";
    }
}
```

*View (post_view.php):*

```php
<ul>
<?php foreach ($posts as $post): ?>
    <li><?= htmlspecialchars($post) ?></li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
```

MVC keeps your code organized. Data stays in the model, templates stay in the view, and everything is coordinated by the controller. It’s the structure many PHP frameworks follow today.
