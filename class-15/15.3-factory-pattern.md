# 15.3 Factory Pattern

Next up is the **Factory pattern**. A factory creates objects for you. Instead of using `new` everywhere, you centralize how objects are built. This is useful when the creation steps vary or when you want consistent initialization.

```php
<?php
class User {
    public function __construct(public string $name, public string $role) {}
}

class UserFactory {
    public static function create(string $type) {
        return match($type) {
            'admin' => new User("Admin User", "admin"),
            'guest' => new User("Guest User", "guest"),
            default => new User("Standard User", "user"),
        };
    }
}

$admin = UserFactory::create('admin');
```

This pattern cleans up your codebase by moving object-creation logic into one place. It also makes testing easier because you can swap factories without touching the rest of your application.
