# 15.4 Strategy Pattern

The **Strategy pattern** lets you change behavior at runtime. You define a family of interchangeable algorithms and plug them into a class as needed.

It's great when you want flexible behavior—like choosing between different ways to process or validate data.

```php
<?php
interface PaymentStrategy {
    public function pay(float $amount);
}

class PayPal implements PaymentStrategy {
    public function pay(float $amount) {
        echo "Paying $amount with PayPal.";
    }
}

class CreditCard implements PaymentStrategy {
    public function pay(float $amount) {
        echo "Paying $amount with a credit card.";
    }
}

class Checkout {
    public function __construct(private PaymentStrategy $method) {}

    public function process(float $amount) {
        $this->method->pay($amount);
    }
}

$checkout = new Checkout(new PayPal());
$checkout->process(50);
```

Strategy helps you avoid big `if/else` blocks. You swap behaviors by injecting a different object. It keeps your code more modular and easier to extend.
